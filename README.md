# DirecTV Cisco router troubleshooting on data center
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
DirecTV experienced issues with one of their routers in our data center. After contacting them, I was tasked with troubleshooting the issue to restore services promptly
<h2>My Role</h2>
As the NOC technician assigned to the task, I coordinated with the support team to identify the issue with the switch. After inspecting the router, which was not responding, I decided to restart it. However, this didn't resolve the problem. I then removed the router from the rack to check if the power supply was the issue, but that wasn't the case. Upon inspecting the (NIC), I noticed it appeared to be functioning correctly. After re plugging everything together, the IP address still wasn't responding to ping requests. At this point, the network engineer from DirecTV and I concluded that the router had failed. He then requested that a replacement router be sent to the data center.
The installation of the new router was straightforward. The only issue was that we were missing one of the NICs, so we decided to reuse the NIC from the old router. After completing the installation and placing the router in the rack, everything was functioning as expected
